#Background
These dotfiles require [Homeshick] (https://github.com/andsens/homeshick) and utilize the [Bash-it framework] (https://github.com/revans/bash-it) for script management.


#Install instructions
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chriselly/dotfiles.git $HOME/.homesick/repos/dotfiles
$HOME/.homesick/repos/dotfiles/install.sh
```

The install script will ask you if agree to it overwriting the existing dotfiles (see the full list [here] (https://github.com/chriselly/dotfiles/tree/master/home)).

After that it will begin setting up some defaults, asking a few questions until it finishes.

Use at your own risk, these are my own dotfiles and really only intended for my own personal use.
