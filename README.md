#Background
These dotfiles require [Homeshick] (https://github.com/andsens/homeshick) and utilize the [Bash-it framework] (https://github.com/revans/bash-it) for script management.


#Install instructions
```bash
git clone git://github.com/andsens/homeshick.git $HOME/.homesick/repos/homeshick
$HOME/.homesick/repos/homeshick/bin/homeshick clone chriselly/dotfiles
```

Homeshick will ask you immediately whether you want to symlink the newly cloned castle. If you agree to that and also agree to it overwriting the existing dotfiles (like `.bashrc` and `.bash_profile` see the full list in [this repo] (https://github.com/chriselly/dotfiles/tree/master/home)).

Use at your own risk, these are my own dotfiles and really only intended for my own personal use.
